## Usage

### Traffic Light Circuit

1. Connect the components as per the circuit diagram.
2. Power up the circuit.
3. Observe the sequential lighting of LEDs.

### IR Module using Op-Amp

1. Connect the IR sensor module and op-amp as per the circuit diagram.
2. Power up the circuit.
3. Test the circuit by introducing infrared signals.

## Troubleshooting

- For Traffic Light Circuit:
  - Check for loose wires in connections.
  - Verify correct placement and orientation of components.
  - Ensure power supply meets circuit requirements.

- For IR Module using Op-Amp:
  - Check IR sensor connections.
  - Ensure op-amp is correctly configured.
  - Verify power supply compatibility.
